# Towow vNext — Stop hook: verify-gate (contract-driven).
#
# Replaces `stop-evaluator.py` (Phase 1 §3.3). Stop is allowed only when the current mode's
# active review-contract bindings have their required evidence packet present, schema-valid,
# and clear of block-severity blockers.
#
# WP-029 prep (contract-driven refactor):
#   - Reads `review-contract.yaml` at runtime (plugin-relative: `<plugin-root>/contracts/`).
#     The YAML is the single source of truth for which bindings fire. Flipping
#     `active: true/false` in YAML changes behaviour without touching code.
#   - Packaged as plugin `towow-review-toolkit` at WP-037. Paths SCHEMA_PATH / CONTRACT_PATH
#     resolve relative to this script's location (see _PLUGIN_ROOT below).
#   - Stop only consults bindings whose `applies_when.mode == current_mode` AND whose
#     `applies_when` carries NO `transition_target`. Bindings with transition_target gate
#     mode transitions (handled by `.claude/plugins/towow-mode-toolkit/skills/mode/transition.py`), not Stop.
#     This resolves the historical Stop/transition conflation in which `mode=verify` Stop
#     demanded a merge_ready packet — merge_ready is a verify→release transition gate,
#     not a Stop gate. Stop ≠ Completion.
#   - Output uses the official Claude Code Stop-hook schema:
#       allow → stdout systemMessage + exit 0 (no top-level "decision").
#       block → stdout `{"decision": "block", "reason": "..."}` + exit 0.
#       fail-closed → exit 2 + stderr. Used when the contract YAML is unreadable.
#     The prior `{"decision": "defer"}` form is NOT a valid Stop-hook decision
#     (Claude Code hooks only accept "block" for Stop). It was a latent no-op since
#     WP-024; removed here.
#   - SHADOW=1 mode preserved: a would-be block downgrades to allow with a
#     `[SHADOW]` systemMessage and a one-line log entry.
