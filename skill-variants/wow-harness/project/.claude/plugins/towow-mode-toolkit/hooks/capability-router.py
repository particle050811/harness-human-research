# Towow vNext — PreToolUse hook: capability-router.
#
# Routes tool calls by the current run's mode. The mode file (.towow/state/mode) is the single
# runtime source of truth. No prompt text governs what tools are available; this hook does.
#
# Addresses Phase 1 §6.3 (mode collapse), §3.1 (CLAUDE.md overloaded constitution), §3.2 (six
# unfielded agents inherit everything). Grounded in Phase 2 §1.3 (hooks deny/defer/ask/allow),
# §2.1 (Codex sandboxing as the reference capability-layer model).
#
# Decision precedence at PreToolUse: deny > defer > ask > allow. This hook emits the lowest
# precedence result that fits. "defer" is used instead of "deny" whenever a mode transition would
# legitimately unblock the call — so the model gets a recoverable signal.
#
# WP-014 install-mode semantics:
#   - Default mode is `legacy`, which allows every tool (full pass-through). Installing the router
#     in `legacy` is a no-behavior-change step; enforcement is added by later WPs flipping the mode.
#   - The router lazily creates `.towow/state/mode` = `legacy` on first call if missing, and also
#     lazily seeds `.towow/state/run.json` and `.towow/state/locks.json` as empty JSON objects.
#     `.towow/state/*` is .gitignored (with `.gitkeep` preserved), so these writes never appear in
#     `git status` as tracked changes.
#
# WP-016 shadow-run semantics:
#   - When the environment variable SHADOW=1 is set, any `deny` or `defer` decision is downgraded
#     to `allow` at the decision boundary, and the *would-have* outcome is appended as one JSON
#     line to `.towow/metrics/router-shadow.jsonl` (schema: §1.4.1 canonical 9-field form; runtime
#     rows are tagged `source: "canary"`). `.towow/metrics/` is .gitignored, so the log never
#     dirties the working tree.
#   - The blocking WP-016 exit gate is the §1.4 synthetic-probe evidence triple under
#     `.towow/evidence/wp-016/` (router-shadow.jsonl with `source: "probe"`, coverage-summary.json
#     with every ratio == 1.0, shadow-ready.json countersigned by a human reviewer). Probes are
#     produced deterministically by `scripts/probes/router/probe.py`; coverage + gate signal by
#     `scripts/probes/router/coverage.py`. See docs/decisions/decision-shadow-router-synthetic-
#     probe-2026-04-16.md.
#   - Real-world / canary observation (via `shadow-saturation.py` + the runtime SHADOW=1 log) is
#     optional, non-blocking post-gate signal per 10-execution-controller.md §1.4; does NOT block
#     WP-017.
#   - Shadow mode is the default during WP-016; WP-017+ flip SHADOW off for one mode at a time.
#     Unsetting SHADOW=1 restores full enforcement.
#
# WP-017 rewrite (CC-schema-compliant output; replaces failed 0eedbd0c):
#   - Every router exit site converts from the internal {decision: allow|deny|defer} to CC's
#     hookSpecificOutput form per cc_mapping_contract (11-execution-state.json →
#     accepted_planning_patches[0]):
#       internal allow → permissionDecision: allow
#       internal deny  → permissionDecision: deny
#       internal defer → permissionDecision: deny + mode-switch hint (interactive, default)
#                        permissionDecision: ask (non-interactive, TOWOW_NONINTERACTIVE=1)
#   - Legacy {decision: approve|block} form is NOT used (no ask path, weaker reason passthrough).
#   - ENFORCED_MODES: set of modes graduated out of shadow. When mode in ENFORCED_MODES, the
#     SHADOW=1 downgrade is bypassed and the CC-mapped deny/ask flows through to the caller.
#     WP-017 adds "plan"; WP-018/019/020 extend one mode at a time.
#   - Concept informed by 0eedbd0c but implemented fresh (not transplanted).
#
# WP-018 extension (build-mode enforcement + finding WP-017-AXIS-3-F-001 remediation):
#   - ENFORCED_MODES += "build". In build mode, SHADOW=1's deny/ask→allow downgrade is bypassed;
#     RULES strictly apply via cc_mapping_contract.
#   - Finding WP-017-AXIS-3-F-001 (axis-3, medium, non-blocking for WP-017 exit): the `plan` mode
#     ruleset did not whitelist the mode-transition handlers, so an agent in plan mode could not
#     self-advance to build via `bash .claude/skills/mode/build.sh` or
#     `python3 .claude/skills/mode/transition.py build`. Only a human slash-command could unlock
#     it. That is a capability gap, not a deliberate write-freeze — plan→build is a legitimate
#     allowed transition per mode-contract §4.
#     Remediation (option a from runtime-signoff.json): add narrow bash globs for the mode skill
#     handlers to both plan.bash_allow AND build.bash_allow (symmetric, so any enforced mode can
#     transition to any other enforced mode). Rationale for option a over option b (adding
#     `Skill` to plan.allow): option a keeps the surface minimal — only the exact handler paths
#     — and preserves plan's write-freeze posture on every other Bash command.
#   - deploy-guard.py: referenced by the WP-018 backlog special note, but NOT present in this
#     chain's scripts/hooks/ directory. No double-denial concern exists today. If a future WP
#     reintroduces deploy-guard.py, hook ordering between router and deploy-guard should be
#     validated via a follow-up planning patch (per backlog special note) — do NOT reshuffle
#     hook order from inside a mode-enforcement WP.
#
# WP-018a extension (RULES table gains target-path scoping; carry-in from WP-018 axis-3):
#   - RULES schema gains a new optional field per mode: `write_path_allow: list[str] | None`.
#     When set, Write/Edit target paths (tool_input["file_path"]) are matched against the
#     list using fnmatch.fnmatchcase; on match → allow; on no-match → deny with a
#     write-path-deny rule identity. When `write_path_allow` is absent or None, the field is
#     not consulted (preserves today's tool-name-only semantics for modes that don't opt in).
#   - decide() is extended so that for tool in {"Write", "Edit"} AND `tool in rule["allow"]`
#     AND `rule.get("write_path_allow") is not None`, the target path is consulted before
#     returning allow. If it is outside the allowed glob set, the result is a terminal deny
#     (no cross-mode path-defer — the agent reads the reason string and switches mode itself;
#     adding cross-mode path-defer adds complexity for marginal UX gain).
#   - Per-mode `write_path_allow` populated per WP-018a scope:
#       plan:    [".towow/plan/**", "docs/plans/**", "docs/decisions/**"]
#       build:   ["**"]  — explicit broad; preserves today's behavior, makes scope visible
#       verify:  [".towow/evidence/**", "docs/reports/**"]
#       release: [".towow/release/**", "CHANGELOG.md", "VERSION"]
#       legacy:  not set — pass-through already handles via rule["allow"] == "*"
#   - plan.allow / verify.allow / release.allow gain Write + Edit (gated by write_path_allow).
#     build.allow already has them; its write_path_allow = ["**"] is a no-op at runtime but
#     makes the "build can write anywhere" decision visible (so future narrowing is a RULES
#     edit, not a schema migration).
#   - verify.bash_allow / release.bash_allow gain the `bash .claude/skills/mode/*` and
#     `python3 .claude/skills/mode/transition.py*` pair (findings WP-018-AXIS-3-SIB-003/004 —
#     symmetric to the plan/build remediation landed in WP-018).
#   - release.allow no longer contains the dead `"Bash"` entry (finding WP-018-AXIS-3-SIB-005).
#     decide() special-cases Bash via bash_allow; the dead entry never influenced runtime.
#   - Bash path-target analysis is explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for this pass. A Bash command that
#     writes to a file (via `>`, `>>`, `tee`, `cp`, `mv`, `dd`, etc.) is NOT checked against
#     write_path_allow — coverage relies on bash_allow/bash_deny as today. Future WPs may add
#     a best-effort Bash-write extractor; until then, modes with a narrow bash_allow are the
#     trust boundary. See docs/contracts/rules-schema.md §Ambiguous Bash targets.
#   - Glob semantics: fnmatch.fnmatchcase (Python stdlib) — `*` matches any string INCLUDING
#     `/`, so `**` is equivalent to `*`. This is deliberately different from shell globbing.
#     Patterns are matched against the file_path as provided by CC (normalized: absolute paths
#     under cwd are shortened to relative).
